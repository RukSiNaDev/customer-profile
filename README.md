## ‚ú® Design & Implementation Highlights

This section focuses on meeting the design requirements and the specific technical challenges addressed in the code.

### 1. Design Source

The application is built based on the provided design specification.

* **Figma Design Link:** [‡πÇ‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏î‡πÉ‡∏™‡πà‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏Å‡πå Figma ‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏ò‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ì‡∏∞‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏ô‡∏µ‡πà]

### 2. Advanced Responsive Layout

The layout uses **Tailwind CSS Grid** to achieve two distinct display behaviors based on screen size, ensuring an optimal user experience across devices:

| Screen Size | Layout | Order of Elements | Technical Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Desktop / Tablet** (`md` breakpoint and up) | **2-Column Layout** | Retains the original visual structure (Profile/Metrics on Left, Contact/Activity on Right). | Achieved using `md:grid-cols-2` combined with **`md:col-start/end`** and **`md:row-start/end`** utilities to place components precisely. |
| **Mobile** (Small screens) | **1-Column Stack** | Custom, interleaved order: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5**. (Profile ‚Üí Contact ‚Üí Spend ‚Üí Purchases ‚Üí Activity). | Achieved using **`order-[n]`** utilities on individual components when the grid collapses to one column. |

> **Note on Vertical Balance:** The `Recent Activity` card is dynamically sized using **`md:row-end-4`** on desktop to span multiple rows, ensuring the vertical balance of the right column matches the stacked metrics cards on the left column.
